# RL Module

This module contains the cleaned-up RL stack for SUMO traffic-light control.
The module is organized around component roles:

- `local_controller`: per-TAZ traffic-light policy.
- `coordinator`: global policy that emits one coordination price per TAZ.
- `coordinated_controller`: full architecture composed of local controller plus coordinator.

## Files

- `settings.py`: central configuration for experiment length, day filters, demand noise, environment parameters, PPO hyperparameters, and output paths.
- `traffic_demand.py`: builds the training schedule, applies weekday filters, samples reproducible demand noise, and generates or reuses SUMO route caches.
- `environment.py`: defines `CoordinatedTazTrafficEnv`, the SUMO environment wrapper with TAZ-to-TAZ flow tracking.
- `policy.py`: defines the shared multi-discrete actor-critic used by both the local controller and the coordinator.
- `ppo.py`: contains PPO utilities, GAE computation, advantage normalization, entropy scheduling, seed setup, and optimizer-state helpers.
- `coordination.py`: builds TAZ adjacency, coordinator observations, local price features, and coordination reward shaping.
- `checkpoints.py`: contains checkpoint loading, local-pretraining weight loading, resume helpers, and CSV/JSON history helpers.
- `train_local_controller.py`: trains only the local per-TAZ traffic-light controller, without the global coordinator.
- `train_coordinated_controller.py`: trains the coordinated architecture using a local controller plus global coordinator.
- `compare_coordinated_controller.py`: compares baseline, local-only RL, and coordinated RL on the same SUMO route scenario.

## Schedule And Demand

`train_days` in `settings.py` means target number of training episodes, not a
calendar-day window. With:

```python
train_days = 200
focus_hours = (7, 8)
```

the training schedule contains exactly 200 date/hour episodes.

Supported `day_filter` values:

- `all`
- `weekdays`
- `weekends`
- explicit weekday lists such as `lun-mer-sab`

Italian and English weekday aliases are accepted, for example `lun`, `mer`,
`sab`, `mon`, `wed`, and `sat`.

Demand is randomized but reproducible. The base seed remains `42`, and demand
noise is deterministically derived from the seed, episode index, date, and hour.
Generated route caches are written under:

```text
sumoenv/routes_rl_module_randomized/
```

Each route path includes the vehicle count, demand-noise tag, base seed, and
route seeds, so scenarios are explicit and reproducible.

## Usage

Run commands from the repository root with the `bomodt` environment active:

```bash
conda activate bomodt
```

### 1. Inspect The Schedule

Before launching SUMO, inspect the randomized schedule:

```bash
python rl_module/train_local_controller.py \
  --dry-run-schedule \
  --show-episodes 10
```

The coordinated trainer uses the same schedule logic:

```bash
python rl_module/train_coordinated_controller.py \
  --dry-run-schedule \
  --show-episodes 10
```

### 2. Train Local Controllers Only

Run full local-only training:

```bash
python rl_module/train_local_controller.py
```

Run a short debug training:

```bash
python rl_module/train_local_controller.py --max-episodes 2
```

Local-only outputs are written to:

```text
rl_module/checkpoints/local_controller/
rl_module/history/local_controller.csv
rl_module/history/local_controller.json
rl_module/details/local_controller/
```

The main checkpoint used by later coordinated training is:

```text
rl_module/checkpoints/local_controller/local_controller_best.pt
```

### 3. Train The Coordinated Controller

Run coordinated training:

```bash
python rl_module/train_coordinated_controller.py
```

Run a short debug training:

```bash
python rl_module/train_coordinated_controller.py --max-episodes 2
```

The coordinated trainer tries to initialize the local part from:

```text
rl_module/checkpoints/local_controller/local_controller_best.pt
```

If that file does not exist, the script prints a warning and starts the local
controller from random weights.

Coordinated outputs are written to:

```text
rl_module/checkpoints/coordinated_controller/
rl_module/history/coordinated_controller.csv
rl_module/history/coordinated_controller.json
rl_module/details/coordinated_controller/
```

### 4. Compare Baseline, Local RL, And Coordinated RL

Run the full comparison when both checkpoints are available:

```bash
python rl_module/compare_coordinated_controller.py \
  --date 2024-10-10 \
  --timeslot 08:00-09:00 \
  --local-checkpoint rl_module/checkpoints/local_controller/local_controller_best.pt \
  --checkpoint rl_module/checkpoints/coordinated_controller/coordinated_controller_best.pt \
  --stochastic-runs 3
```

Run only baseline vs local RL:

```bash
python rl_module/compare_coordinated_controller.py \
  --date 2024-10-10 \
  --timeslot 08:00-09:00 \
  --skip-coordinated \
  --stochastic-runs 3
```

Run only baseline vs coordinated RL:

```bash
python rl_module/compare_coordinated_controller.py \
  --date 2024-10-10 \
  --timeslot 08:00-09:00 \
  --skip-local \
  --stochastic-runs 3
```

Comparison reports are written under:

```text
rl_module/evaluation_reports/coordinated_controller/<date>/<timeslot>/<demand>/
```

The JSON report includes these sections when the corresponding run is enabled:

- `baseline`
- `local_greedy`
- `local_stochastic_mean`
- `coordinated_greedy`
- `coordinated_stochastic_mean`
- `comparison_local_greedy`
- `comparison_local_stochastic_mean`
- `comparison_coordinated_greedy`
- `comparison_coordinated_stochastic_mean`
